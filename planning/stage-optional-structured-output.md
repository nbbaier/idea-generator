### Optional: Structured output instead of Markdown

Todos:

-  [ ] Change API to return JSON `{ title, description, features[], techStack[], complexity }`.
-  [ ] Create a `ProjectIdeaView` component that renders the structured data with semantic HTML.
-  [ ] Preserve a "Copy as Markdown" action by generating Markdown client-side from the structure.
-  [ ] Update tests and types; remove unused `ProjectIdea` or align it to the API.
